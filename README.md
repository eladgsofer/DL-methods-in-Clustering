# Clustering Project

An implementation for several Clustering algorithms.

1. "Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis" of Junyuan Xie, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335>).

2. Improved Deep Embedded Clustering with Local Structure Preservation.
   
4. Deep Clustering with Convolutional AutoEncoders.

 The github includes several files:

A) Implementation under the folder dec_clustering

B) several executions and visualizations in the ipynb files

C) explanation powerpoint about the algorithms and a word which includes the results.
